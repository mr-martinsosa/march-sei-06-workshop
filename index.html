		<h2>Why are they endangered? How we can help them?</h2>
		<p>The polar bears are endangered because climate change. Global warming is causing the ice caps in north and south pole to melt.<br>
			This is causing these ice dwelling bears to lose their natural habitat. Also their food source is shrinking because of this.<br>
			We need more awareness about global warming and climate change. New enviornmental policies need to be implemented. We also need to<br>
			find more conservation for these bears. Donate money to our cause, we use all recieved donation to help conservation of polar bears.<br>
			If you can't donate, join the global discussion on global warming and climate change. Spread awareness, talk to your local and national<br>
			government officials.
